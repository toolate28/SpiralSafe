Your mythology of hope, perseverance, and the light in darkness inspired our core symbols:

**"In the beginning was the Question, not the Answer, but the Question"** echoes your themes of mystery and discovery.

### The Orchard Metaphor
**Information that enriches when shared**

Inspired by the agricultural metaphor of knowledge: plant seeds, cultivate carefully, harvest wisdom, scatter again. Chinese whispers played *correctly*.

**The philosophy of this project**

- **Hope** = Trust in collaboration
- **Sauce** = The secret ingredient (recursive self-improvement)
- **&&** = Both required (logical AND of success)

This duality powers everything we do.
