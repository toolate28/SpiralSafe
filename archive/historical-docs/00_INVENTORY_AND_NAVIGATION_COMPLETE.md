## 📌 What's NOT in This Package (Intentionally)

- Generic "agile" advice (not applicable)
- Tool recommendations (framework-agnostic)
- Specific company/department case studies (you'll apply to yours)
- PowerPoint templates (you'll create your own)
- Training slide decks (in curriculum, but you'll customize)

**Why?** Those things vary by context. This package is the universal layer.

- ✅ Cross-references between documents work
- ✅ Examples are specific and concrete
- ✅ Every claim has evidence or grounding
- ✅ Implementation steps are actionable
- ✅ Failure modes are realistic
- ✅ Recovery procedures are clear
- ✅ Measurement frameworks are specific
- ✅ Training materials are complete
- ✅ Adaptations for constraints are realistic

## 🎯 The Promise

When you hand this package to someone and say "here's everything about Safe Spiral," they should:

1. Feel like they understand what it is
2. Understand where it came from (not random)
3. See how to implement it (not theoretical)
4. Know what success looks like (not vague)
5. Know what breaks and how to fix it (not naive)
6. Feel equipped to teach others (not lost)
7. Know how to adapt it (not brittle)
8. Feel like nothing was left undone (no "stove on")

**That's the completeness bar.**

## 📞 What To Do If Something's Missing

If you find yourself asking:
- "How do I explain this to X?" → It's in the material
- "What if Y happens?" → It's in Failure Modes
- "Can I use this in [context]?" → It's in Adaptation sections
- "What do people usually object to?" → It's in FAQ
- "How do I know if it's working?" → It's in Measurement Framework

**If you can't find the answer, there's a gap in the package.**
