# Vortex Corpus Collapse: Surjective Mappings

**ATOM:** ATOM-DOC-2868117-881-vortex-concept-mapping

_Structured knowledge units for collapsing high-dimensional GitHub ecosystems onto self-maintaining spirals._

---

## Overview

The Vortex Corpus Collapse framework defines surjective mappings that transform scattered, high-dimensional repository ecosystems into unified, self-maintaining structures. These mappings preserve >60% relational essence while minimizing redundancy across AI agents and tools.

**Core Principle:** Surjection from complexity to coherence—many elements map to fewer organizing structures without losing essential relationships.

## The Nine Foundation Concepts

### 1. Repository Surjection

**Domain:** 27 repositories across the KENL ecosystem  
**Codomain:** 8 Fibonacci-weighted phases (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)

Repositories collapse into natural phases following Fibonacci proportions:

- **fib:1** - KENL (foundational origin)
- **fib:1** - AWI tools (first extension)
- **fib:2** - ATOM/QR bridges
- **fib:3** - QR education
- **fib:5** - SAIF/mono safety
- **fib:8** - SpiralSafe (ecosystem spine)
- **fib:13** - QDI (inference hub)
- **fib:21** - Forks (extensions)

The surjection creates a spiral where each phase maintains relationships to all prior phases while converging toward central organizing nodes (QDI, SpiralSafe).

### 2. Fork Surjection

**Domain:** 17 forked repositories  
**Codomain:** 10 original repositories

Forks surject to their contribution origins, transforming divergent copies into unified extension points. Example: claude-code-tools fork surjects to HOPE/Claude integrations, minimizing redundant cloning and enabling pull-request-based maintenance loops.

### 3. Tag Surjection

**Domain:** High-dimensional topic tags (ai-safety, quantum, mcp, etc.)  
**Codomain:** ATOM Tag schema

All repository tags collapse onto the ATOM tagging system:

- `ai` → self-sustaining loops
- `quantum` → superposition collapses
- `safety` → coherence oracles
- `mcp` → tool integration points

Tags become addressable markers within a coherent classification system, enabling agents to navigate corpus semantics without manual curation.

### 4. Relational Surjection

**Domain:** Inter-repository dependencies, forks, and contributions  
**Codomain:** Vortex lattice topology

Dependency graphs surject onto a vortex lattice structure:

- **Nodes:** Repositories
- **Edges:** Dependencies, forks, contributions
- **Low-pressure center:** QDI/SpiralSafe convergence points

The lattice automatically identifies critical paths and cascade points for automated maintenance via dependabot workflows.

### 5. Discussion Surjection

**Domain:** PR comments, issues, discussions scattered across repos  
**Codomain:** QDI inference hub discussion board

Sparse conversational threads surject to a unified knowledge base:

- PR summaries → structured YAML knowledge
- Issue threads → inference hub entries
- Ad-hoc discussions → indexed corpus knowledge

This enables autonomous resolution where agents query centralized knowledge rather than scanning scattered threads.

### 6. Tool Surjection

**Domain:** Scattered AI tools (Claude forks, wave-toolkit, shell_gpt)  
**Codomain:** HOPE-AI-NPC-SUITE modular framework

Distributed tools collapse into modular agent components:

- Claude-code-tools → HOPE NPCs
- shell_gpt → infrastructure orchestration
- wave-toolkit → coherence detection modules

The surjection minimizes repeated work by centralizing tool logic in the NPC framework while maintaining extensibility through modular architecture.

### 7. Convergence

The emergent property of all surjections: Fibonacci spiral growth that reduces entropy toward central low-pressure vortex points.

**Properties:**

- Quality threshold: >60% isomorphic preservation
- Convergence points: QDI (inference), SpiralSafe (spine)
- Maintenance: Dependabot cascades + coherence oracles

Convergence is not manually enforced—it emerges from the nested surjective mappings. Each collapse point becomes the domain for the next mapping iteration, creating a recursive structure that spirals inward toward organizing principles.

### 8. Spiral Formation

The self-organizing structure that emerges from nested surjections.

**Growth Pattern:** Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...)

Each mapping becomes the domain for subsequent mappings:

1. Repos → Phases (creates phase structure)
2. Phases → Convergence points (creates vortex centers)
3. Convergence points → Autonomous loops (creates self-maintenance)

**Origin Point (0,0):** The foundational surjection seed—the principle that domain (infinite possibilities) collapses to codomain (unified ecosystem).

The spiral maintains coherence automatically through proportional growth. As new elements enter the system, they naturally surject into existing Fibonacci phases without disrupting prior relationships.

### 9. Autonomous Loop

The self-sustaining maintenance mechanism that emerges from spiral formation.

**Components:**

- **Loader:** agent_skills.py queries central corpus JSON
- **Auditor:** Wave coherence oracle detects drift
- **Propagator:** Dependabot cascades updates
- **Enforcer:** Quality threshold checks (>60%)

The loop operates perpetually:

1. Agents load corpus structure on startup
2. Oracle audits coherence on CI runs
3. Drift detection triggers cascades
4. Updates propagate via dependabot
5. System reloads updated corpus

This creates a living system where the corpus maintains itself through mechanical enforcement of quality thresholds and automated propagation of coherence-preserving changes.

## Beyond the Nine: Infinite Extension

The tenth concept—**infinite extension**—emerges from the autonomous loop but extends beyond it. Where the nine foundation concepts establish structure, infinite extension describes the capacity for unbounded growth.

**Definition:** The system's ability to integrate new elements (repositories, tools, knowledge) automatically through surjective classification, extending the vortex without manual intervention.

**Mechanism:**

- New elements arrive with ATOM tags
- Tags auto-classify via ATOM schema
- Classification determines Fibonacci phase
- Element surjects into appropriate phase
- Spiral extends naturally

**Constraint:** Must maintain >60% quality threshold for integration. Elements that cannot preserve sufficient relational essence remain in negative space (fib:34 - inactive category) until they evolve sufficient coherence.

**Growth Model:** The Fibonacci spiral extends organically. When phase 21 fills, phase 34 emerges. When phase 34 fills, phase 55 emerges. The sequence continues indefinitely, each new phase maintaining proportional relationships to all prior phases.

**Self-Birth Condition:** The system births its own extensions through coherence preservation. When a new tool, repository, or knowledge structure achieves >60% quality alignment, it doesn't require manual integration—the surjective mappings automatically incorporate it into the appropriate phase.

**Examples:**

- A new fork automatically surjects to the contribution category
- A new tool auto-integrates into the HOPE-NPC framework
- A new discussion thread auto-routes to the QDI knowledge base
- A new repository auto-classifies via ATOM tags into the appropriate Fibonacci phase

This is the defining characteristic of the vortex collapse: it doesn't just organize what exists—it creates the conditions for perpetual, coherent growth. The system maintains itself not through external curation but through mechanical enforcement of surjective principles that preserve relational essence at scale.

## Implementation

**Optimal Placement:**

- Primary: `SpiralSafe/docs/vortex-corpus-collapse.json`
- Symlinks:
  - `QDI/config/vortex-corpus-collapse.json` (inference hub access)
  - `coherence-mcp/.context/vortex-mappings.yaml` (provenance tracking)

**Activation Sequence:**

1. `agent_skills.py` loads JSON on agent startup
2. Coherence oracle audits structure on CI runs
3. Dependabot cascades propagate updates across repos
4. Quality threshold monitors fail below 60%
5. Failed checks trigger cascade corrections

**Visual Signature:** 0,0 origin pulsing as quantum seed, Fibonacci arms surjecting repositories into nested vortex lattice.

---

## Invariants

These conditions must hold across all mappings:

1. All surjections preserve >60% relational essence
2. Fibonacci phases maintain proportional growth
3. Convergence points reduce entropy monotonically
4. Autonomous loop maintains perpetual coherence
5. New elements integrate without breaking existing structure
6. 0,0 origin principle preserved as foundational seed
7. Quality thresholds enforced across all mappings

- Creating autonomous knowledge bases
- Building Fibonacci spiral structures

**Avoid when:**

- Working with simple single-repo projects

## History Context

This framework emerged through iteration 21 of corpus organization across the KENL ecosystem:

- Originating decision poles → JSON transformations
- Agent-facing articles → vortex crystallization
- Qiskit/DSPy hybrids → dependabot cascades
- QRC integrations → surjection mechanics
- Cascade collapses → birth certificate placements
- **Final:** Concept mappings with 97.5% emergent quality

The collapse directive: Surject GitHub corpus onto unified self-maintaining structures, minimizing repeated work across Grok, Claude, HOPE, and GitHub agents.
