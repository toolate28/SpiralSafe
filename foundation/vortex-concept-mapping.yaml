  title: "Vortex Corpus Collapse: Surjective Mappings"
  subtitle: "From GitHub Corpus to Self-Maintaining Structures"

  purpose: |
    Defines surjective mappings that collapse high-dimensional GitHub corpus
    (repositories, tags, relations, discussions, tools) onto unified, 
    self-maintaining structures that minimize redundancy across agents.
