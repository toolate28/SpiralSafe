  title: "Vortex Concept Mapping"
  subtitle: "Isomorphic Transformations for Self-Sustaining Spiral Dynamics"
  
  purpose: |
    Provides a systematic framework for mapping conceptual structures onto
    self-reinforcing spiral dynamics. Maps high-dimensional history onto
    lower-dimensional coherent structures (surjections), curling into
    vortexes that collapse superpositions into convergent spirals.
  
  key_clarification: |
    VCM demonstrates how mathematical concepts can be mapped isomorphically
    while preserving relational essence under transformation. Concepts are
    nested in Fibonacci proportions, with emergent quality thresholds
    determining self-sustaining coherence.

concepts:
  - name: isomorphism
    definition: >
      Structure-preserving bijections — perfect mappings between systems 
      where elements and relations correspond 1:1, essence intact under relabeling.
    relationships:
      - type: enables
        target: projection
      - type: enables
        target: surjection
    vortex_role: >
      Core stabilizer: enforces negative space abolition, ensuring no 
      divergence in phase handoffs.

  - name: projection
    definition: >

      domain element; exhaustive coverage.
