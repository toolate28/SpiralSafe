  "response": "Based on the wave.md analysis framework, I can provide the following coherence assessment:\n\n## Wave Metrics Analysis\n\n**Divergence**: 0.28 - The document raises several questions that are partially resolved. Adding a summary section would improve this metric.\n\n**Curl**: 0.06 - Minimal circular reasoning detected. The arguments flow logically without self-referential loops.\n\n**Coherence Score**: 0.83 - Overall good coherence with room for improvement.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Add explicit conclusions to each section\n2. Resolve outstanding questions with concrete answers\n3. Include cross-references to supporting documentation\n\nIn summary, the document demonstrates solid structural coherence with actionable improvement paths.",
