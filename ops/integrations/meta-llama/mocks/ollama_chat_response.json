The main areas for improvement are:\n1. Section 3 could benefit from concrete examples\n2. The conclusion needs explicit action items\n\n**H&&S:WAVE Handoff:**\nThis analysis is complete and ready for review. The wave signature indicates soft handoff - review welcome.\n\nIn conclusion, the documentation is well-structured with clear paths for enhancement."
