## What This Means

**Code (*.ps1, *.ts, *.js, *.java, *.css, *.html):** MIT License
**Documentation (*.md, *.txt, PDF files):** CC BY-SA 4.0

**Collaborative Authorship:** 
This work is the product of human-AI collaboration between toolate28 and
Claude, representing the Safe Spiral three-body pattern in practice.

**The Philosophy:**
Information enriches through relay. Use these frameworks, question them hard, find where
they break, pass them forward improved. That's how the spiral continues.
