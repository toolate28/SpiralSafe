# SpiralSafe Glossary

---

## A

**ATOM** — Atomic Task Orchestration Method. Decomposes complex work into independently verifiable units.

**AWI** — Authorization-With-Intent. Permission scaffolding for agent systems requiring intent declaration before action.

---

## B

**B&&P** — Bartimaeus && Ptolemy. Extension of Hope&&Sauced signaling work requiring exceptional trust. References Jonathan Stroud's *Bartimaeus Sequence*.

**BattleMedic** — System recovery orchestration framework using SAIF methodology.

**bump.md** — Protocol for routing and handoff between agents, sessions, and contexts.

---

## C

**Cognitive Orchestration** — Strategic alternation between cognitive modes (spatial/temporal) to match task requirements.

**Compound** — In ATOM: the full project; all molecules combined.

**Constraint** — Limitation that enables creativity by eliminating irrelevant degrees of freedom.

**.context.yaml** — Structured knowledge format for agent consumption.

---

## D

**Day Zero Design** — Philosophy of correct implementation from inception. Invest in architecture before code.

**Dual-Format** — Convention of providing knowledge in both prose and structure. Neither primary.

---

## H

**H&&S** — Shorthand for Hope&&Sauced.

**Hope&&Sauced** — Signature for human-AI collaborative work where both contributions are substantive.

---

## I

**Isomorphism Principle** — Discrete systems instantiate continuous mathematics. The boundary is projection artifact.

---

## K

**KENL** — Knowledge Exchange Network Learning. Infrastructure-aware AI orchestration.

---

## M

**Molecule** — In ATOM: cluster of related atoms accomplishing a sub-goal.

---

## S

**SAIF** — Systematic Analysis and Issue Fixing. Evidence-based diagnostic methodology.

**SpiralSafe** — The coherence engine for collaborative intelligence.

---

## U

**UnifiedComms** — Channel orchestration protocol for substrate-independent message routing.

---

## W

**wave.md** — Coherence detection treating text as vector fields. Measures curl, divergence, potential.

**WAVE** — bump.md marker indicating soft handoff; review welcome, ownership retained.
