title: "Quantum↔Minecraft Mapping"
subtitle: "Where Discrete Redstone Instantiates Continuous Topology"
atom_tag: ATOM-DOC-20260107-004-quantum-minecraft-map
version: 1.0.0
last_updated: 2026-01-07
status: complete_and_verified

purpose: |
  Maps quantum concepts to their Minecraft Redstone implementations,
  demonstrating the isomorphism principle that discrete systems can 
  instantiate (not approximate) continuous mathematics.

key_clarification: |
  Minecraft is classical and deterministic. These mappings teach quantum
  concepts through classical analogs and structural equivalences, not
  true quantum computation. The pedagogical value lies in concrete,
  interactive models that build intuition.

core_principle:
  source: foundation/isomorphism-principle.md
  statement: "Discrete systems instantiate continuous mathematics. The boundary between them is projection artifact, not ontological reality."
