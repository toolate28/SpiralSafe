# Lesson Entry Template

Use this template for concise, reviewable lesson entries destined for the `project-book`.

- **Title:** One-line summary of the lesson
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Source:** (PR/issue/session/script) — include link if available
- **Author / Owner:** Person who wrote the entry
- **Context:** Short paragraph describing the situation and impacted area
- **What happened:** Chronology in 2–4 sentences
- **Root cause / Analysis:** Concise causal analysis (why this happened)
- **Action taken:** What was fixed or mitigations applied
- **Outcome / Metrics:** Pass/fail, verification notes, links to artifacts
- **Follow-ups / Next steps:** Owners + timeline for remaining actions
- **Tags:** e.g., verification, docs, automation, CI, infra

Notes:
- Keep entries short (150–400 words). Link to supporting artifacts instead of embedding large logs.
- Prefer actionable follow-ups with owners and simple acceptance criteria.
