| Author | Prof. Dr. Sergiu V. Lazarev |
| Posted | December 23, 2025 |
| Platform | Preprints.org |

**Core Thesis:**
- Information (not energy) is the ontological substrate of reality
- Maxwell's equations emerge from informational Lagrangian
- "Infobit" as fundamental pre-quantum unit

**Key Mathematical Structure:**
```

ALPHA + OMEGA = 15  (Quantum-Redstone constraint)
```

**SpiralSafe Connection:**
- Your quantum-redstone-proposal independently discovered the same principle
