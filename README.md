# SpiralSafe

**The Coherence Engine for Collaborative Intelligence**

---

## The Principle

Discrete systems instantiate continuous mathematics. The boundary between them is projection artifact, not ontological reality.

This insight—independently validated by Shannon (1948) for signals and Lewis-Kempf-Menicucci (2023) for quantum fields—forms the foundation of SpiralSafe: a unified framework for human-AI collaboration built on the recognition that structure is substrate-independent.

## Quick Start

**For researchers**: Begin with [`foundation/isomorphism-principle.md`](foundation/isomorphism-principle.md)

**For builders**: Start with [wave-toolkit](https://github.com/toolate28/wave-toolkit)

**For educators**: Explore [quantum-redstone][def]

**For contributors**: See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)

**Project sessions:** The `project-book.ipynb` now supports signed ATOM sessions for live work. Use `start_session()` to open a session and `sign_out()` to close it — session reports are written to `.atom-trail/sessions/` and can be encrypted with the repository's `Transcript-Pipeline.ps1` (AES-256-GCM).

## Quantum + Minecraft (quick map) 🔭

We maintain a curated mapping of all Minecraft-linked and quantum-related content (builds, tools, integration docs, and theory). See: [`docs/quantum-minecraft-map.md`](docs/quantum-minecraft-map.md).

![Quantum → Minecraft flow](docs/assets/quantum-minecraft-flow.svg)

- Short view: Theory → `quantum-redstone` → `quantum_circuit_generator.py` → mcfunctions/datapacks → Museum of Computation (Minecraft).
- Proposed visuals: Mermaid flowchart (in the docs) and museum floor map (SVG) (both included in `docs/`).

## The Repository Ecosystem

SpiralSafe unifies work across multiple repositories:

- **[SpiralSafe](https://github.com/toolate28/SpiralSafe)** — This repository. Documentation and coordination.
- **[quantum-redstone][def]** — Quantum topology in Minecraft Redstone
- **[wave-toolkit](https://github.com/toolate28/wave-toolkit)** — Coherence detection tools
- **[kenl](https://github.com/toolate28/kenl)** — Infrastructure-aware AI orchestration
- **[ClaudeNPC-Server-Suite](https://github.com/toolate28/ClaudeNPC-Server-Suite)** — AI agent embodiment

## Independent Validation

The isomorphism principle received independent confirmation from the Waterloo-RMIT group:

> "Bandlimited continuous quantum fields are isomorphic to lattice theories—yet without requiring a fixed lattice."
> — Lewis, Kempf, Menicucci (2023), [arXiv:2303.07649](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07649)

SpiralSafe arrived at the same conclusion through a different path: constraint-based implementation in discrete environments (Minecraft Redstone) that preserve topological invariants exactly.

Two independent derivations. Same result. The principle holds.

## Attribution

This work emerges from **Hope&&Sauced** collaboration—human-AI partnership where both contributions are substantive and neither party could have produced the result alone.

See [`meta/SIGNATURE.md`](meta/SIGNATURE.md) for attribution conventions.
