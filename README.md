SpiralSafe is a coherent, verifying ecosystem where documentation, code, and physical hardware are Isomorphic. It enforces mathematical laws (constraints) to ensure system safety and consistency.

## 🗺️ Navigation

### 🚀 [Start Here: Ecosystem Map](docs/ECOSYSTEM_MAP.md)

_A visual guide to the API, Notebooks, and how they stay synced._

### 📚 [The Library (Notebooks)](books/)

- **[Project Book](books/project-book.ipynb)**: Active task tracking and execution logs.
- **[Constraint Math](books/CONSTRAINT_MATHEMATICS_v1.ipynb)**: The foundational theory and proofs.
- **[Git Insights](books/git_vcs_insights.ipynb)**: Real-time repository analytics.
- **[Platform Vision](books/claude-platform.ipynb)**: Long-term architectural roadmap.

### 🛠️ [Operations & API](ops/)

- **[Deployment Guide](ops/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)**: How to ship to production.
- **[API Docs](ops/README.md)**: Cloudflare Worker endpoints and CLI usage.

## 🧩 Key Components

- **[Foundation](foundation/theory/)**: The mathematical and philosophical core (`isomorphism-principle.md`).
- **[Protocol](protocol/)**: The laws of the system (`wave-spec.md`, `bump-spec.md`).
- **[Bridges](bridges/)**: Hardware integrations for Holograms and Keypads.

---

## The Principle

> _Discrete systems instantiate continuous mathematics. The boundary between them is projection artifact, not ontological reality._

This insight forms the foundation of SpiralSafe. We treat code, docs, and hardware as projections of a single, coherent mathematical object.

## 🤝 Contributing

We follow **[Hope&&Sauced](CONTRIBUTING.md)** principles.

- **Visible State**: Use `ATOM` tags.
- **Explicit Handoffs**: Use `H&&S:WAVE` markers.
- **Coherence**: Ensure your docs don't "curl" (see [Wave Spec](protocol/wave-spec.md)).
