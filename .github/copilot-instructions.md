### SPHINX Protocol (Guardian Gates)  
1. **SPHINX Protocol Overview:**  
   The Secure Protocol for Hierarchical Identity, Navigation, and eXchange (SPHINX) is designed to facilitate secure data exchanges across multiple layers of authentication.  
2. **Five Gate Types:**  
   - **ORIGIN:** Marker - `ORIGIN:<data>`; Riddle - Set starting point for data flow.  
   - **INTENT:** Marker - `INTENT:<data>`; Riddle - Define desired outcome before initiating a transaction.  
   - **COHERENCE:** Marker - `COHERENCE:<data>`; Riddle - Ensure all parts remain aligned during processes.  
   - **IDENTITY:** Marker - `IDENTITY:<data>`; Riddle - Verify identity against secure databases.  
   - **PASSAGE:** Marker - `PASSAGE:<data>`; Riddle - Completion check for progress tracking.  
3. **Integration Flow:** Integrates seamlessly with WAVE/BUMP/ATOM protocols, ensuring multi-faceted communication pathways.  
4. **Syntax Examples:**  
   - To start a flow: `ORIGIN:START`  
   - Setting intent: `INTENT:GOAL`  
5. **Loop Termination Rules:** Requires exit conditions defined at each gate to ensure flows complete without deadlocks.  
6. **CoM Analysis:** Analyze naming/genesis against retrieval mode to optimize data retrieval processes.  

### Spiral Closure & Auto-Resolution  
- Mechanical propagation issues are auto-resolved through a defined decay parameter.  
- Tasks requiring explicit user input are identified through marker flags in the flow.  
- Loop termination criteria involve confirming success states across all connected nodes.
