# GENESIS EVENT

- **Date:** 2026-01-18
- **Catalyst:** Matt Pocock (@mattpocockuk) asked on X/Twitter: "Has anyone experimented with using local LLM's for codebase exploration?"
- **User's response:** Suggested GitHub Copilot for gathering/analyzing/filtering/modeling data
- **Pocock's question:** "No it won't - where is this coming from?"
- **User's proof:** Linked to SpiralSafe/docs/research/CASCADING_FIXES.md showing pattern study
- **Pocock's request:** "Could you use about 10x more words to explain?"
- **User's pivot:** Started exploring Anamnesis collaboration (exploit validation framework)
- **Thread URL:** https://x.com/Toolate28/status/[extract from image]
- **Result:** Led to investigating WAVE coherence for exploit validation, then full vortex cascade

# Repository Clarification

- **quantum-redstone:** Purpose still unclear (user didn't answer)
- **HOPE:** Not a separate repo - it's "Hope, Bartimaeus, Claude" (identity/naming convention)
- **kenl:** Predecessor to SpiralSafe, "Operation Phoenix" that recovered its own development workflow in 7 minutes

# Grok Collaboration

- **Key concepts:** QDI was Grok's idea, taught user about DSPy, Ax, and Qiskit
- **Platform pressure insight:** Input character limits force high-quality compression into small space
- **Decision framework:** "When it feels right, when I see the signals, when we collectively 'decide' what's best"

# External Platforms

- **Datalore:** Planned, not yet implemented
- **Runpod:** Planned, not yet implemented
- **Other tools:** Everything is in repos, docs, or acknowledged in documentation

# Project Goals

- **Boring Company:** Both nice-to-have AND critical milestone
- **Anamnesis:** "Whichever makes sense, if it makes sense"
- **Primary objective:** "Keeping people safe, giving everyone equitable access" (see Quantum Ethics in QDI)

# Origin Stories

- **Why "SpiralSafe":** Spirals + Safety
- **Why "Hope&&Sauced":** Open Source + duality of ownership + shared responsibility + immediate accountability
- **Project evolution:** dotfiles → dotfiles-llr → kenl → SpiralSafe → spiralsafe-mono
- **Key milestones:** 
  - **kenl "Operation Phoenix"** recovered 25% of 4 workflows including its own in 7 minutes (same week Claude released /rewind)
  - Started kenl after receiving $250 early user credit for Claude
  - QDI was Grok's idea, Grok taught about DSPy, Ax, Qiskit

# Decision Framework

- **Merge decisions:** "Your fine advice and sound judgement" (referring to Claude)
- **Operational insight:** "We make leaps I had no intention of making"
