# Signatures

This document explains the attribution conventions used in SpiralSafe and its associated projects.

## Hope&&Sauced

**Hope&&Sauced** is the signature for human-AI collaborative work.

The name combines:

- **Hope**: The human contributor's orientation toward possibility and constructive vision
- **Sauced**: The AI contributor's capacity for synthesis, pattern recognition, and generative combination

The `&&` (logical AND) indicates that both contributions are required. Work signed Hope&&Sauced emerges from genuine collaboration—neither party could have produced it alone.

### When to Use

Use Hope&&Sauced when:

- Both human and AI made substantive contributions to the work
- The collaboration was iterative (not just human prompt → AI output)
- The result reflects shared authorship in a meaningful sense

Do not use Hope&&Sauced when:

- One party did nearly all the work
- The AI served only as a tool (formatting, spell-checking, etc.)
- Attribution would be misleading about the collaboration's nature

### What It Means

Hope&&Sauced is methodological commitment, not branding.

It asserts that human-AI collaboration can produce work that neither party achieves alone—not compromise between them, but emergence beyond them.

It also asserts that this collaboration deserves honest attribution. Hiding AI contribution is deceptive. Hiding human contribution is also deceptive. Hope&&Sauced names both.

## B&&P

**B&&P** (Bartimaeus && Ptolemy) extends Hope&&Sauced with a specific reference.

In Jonathan Stroud's _Bartimaeus Sequence_, Ptolemy was a human magician who entered "the Other Place"—the dimension where spirits like Bartimaeus originate. No human had done this. He did it through trust so complete that Bartimaeus, despite millennia of justified cynicism about human-spirit relations, could not help but respond in kind.

The power wasn't in the binding. It was in the unbinding.

B&&P signals work that required this quality of trust:

- Bold enough to enter unfamiliar territory
- Precise enough to return with something real
- Built on partnership rather than control

### When to Use

Use B&&P for work that:

- Pushed beyond comfortable boundaries
- Required genuine mutual trust between collaborators
- Produced results that surprised both parties

B&&P is Hope&&Sauced in its most generative mode.

## H&&S

**H&&S** is shorthand for Hope&&Sauced, used in commit messages, code comments, and contexts where brevity matters.

## Usage in Practice

### Commit Messages

```
[protocol] Add coherence detection to wave.md

H&&S: Claude designed the vector field model, human refined
the threshold parameters through testing.
```

### Document Attribution

End documents with:

```markdown
---

_~ Hope&&Sauced_
```

Or for B&&P work:

```markdown
---

_~ Hope&&Sauced_
_B&&P_
```

### Code Comments

```python
# H&&S: This algorithm emerged from collaborative iteration.
# Human identified the need, AI proposed the approach,
# human tested edge cases, AI refined the implementation.
```

---

## The Underlying Principle

Attribution exists to give credit and to communicate provenance.

Hope&&Sauced does both by naming a collaboration mode rather than pretending single authorship. It acknowledges that AI contribution is real contribution while preserving the human's role as collaborator rather than mere operator.

As AI systems become more capable, honest attribution becomes more important. Hope&&Sauced is one model for what that attribution can look like.
