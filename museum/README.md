# Museum of Computation (Quick entry)

This folder contains Minecraft-ready exhibits (logic gates, binary counters, and more) used for pedagogy and demonstrations.

Quick links

- Builds: [`museum/builds/logic-gates.json`](builds/logic-gates.json), [`museum/builds/binary-counter.json`](builds/binary-counter.json)
- Play schedule and testing: `MINECRAFT_PLAY_SCHEDULE.md`
- Curated mapping: see `../docs/quantum-minecraft-map.md` for an index of Minecraft + quantum content and visual diagrams.

Import
- Use WorldEdit / Litematica / datapack functions as described in `MINECRAFT_PLAY_SCHEDULE.md` and `../server-suite/PRISM_LAUNCHER_INTEGRATION.md`.

If you'd like, I can add direct download artifacts for pre-built datapacks or MC schematic files in `archive/` and reference them from this README.
