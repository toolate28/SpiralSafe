# Museum of Computation (Quick entry)

This folder contains Minecraft-ready exhibits (logic gates, binary counters, and more) used for pedagogy and demonstrations.

Quick links

- Builds: [`museum/builds/logic-gates.json`](builds/logic-gates.json), [`museum/builds/binary-counter.json`](builds/binary-counter.json)
- Play schedule and testing: `MINECRAFT_PLAY_SCHEDULE.md`
- Curated mapping: see `../docs/quantum-minecraft-map.md` for an index of Minecraft + quantum content and visual diagrams.

Import
- Use WorldEdit / Litematica / datapack functions as described in `MINECRAFT_PLAY_SCHEDULE.md` and `../server-suite/PRISM_LAUNCHER_INTEGRATION.md`.

Downloads (example)

- Prebuilt quantum datapack: [`releases/quantum-datapack-v0.1.zip`](../releases/quantum-datapack-v0.1.zip)
  - Unpack into your Minecraft save's `datapacks/` folder or load with Prism Launcher
  - Use `/function quantum:place_hadamard` in-game to place the example structure

If you want, I can add more artifacts (schematics, Litematica files), or produce teacher-facing lesson packs (slide + step-by-step import instructions).
